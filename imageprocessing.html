									<p>In the field of image processing, I have completed several projects that I would like to share three of them with you.
                                          All of these projects 
                                        were focusing on solving the issue of <b>non-uniform illumination and low contrast images</b>. 
                                        This issue may cause  huge problems in  
                                         many sectors, such as <b>biomedical, security, and marine science</b>.
                                         This issue may occur in the <b>x-ray</b>, <b>microscopic</b>, <b>MRI</b>, <b>underwater</b>, and <b> security 
                                             camera (CCTV)</b> images.
                                              
                                         Below I will take you in a short and brief tour of the three most recent projects of mine,
                                          to show you how I have used image processing to solve three different issues in the biomedical sector.

                                    <h2>Project 1: “Local Neighbourhood Image Properties for Exposure Region Determination Method in Nonuniform Illumination Images.” </h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                        This project is the most recent project that had been done with the co-operation with the Intelligent
                                         system and research team at the school of electrical and electronic engineering at University Science of
                                        Malaysia (USM). This study explains the importance of determining the different areas of illumination
                                        to the enhancement of nonuniform illumination images. Most determination methods divide the regions
                                        of nonuniform illumination images into bright and dark illuminated areas. There are three methods
                                        that divide the non-illumination image into three regions which are ALEBRD, Exposure 3R and 
                                        Backlit. Based on these methods, Backlit and Exposure 3R focus on intensity level only to 
                                        differentiate the area of illumination while ALEBRD evaluates the contrast of local neighbour
                                        based on the intensity. Due to insufficient pixels information since only the intensity is
                                        considered by the existing method, thus leading to the inaccurately determine areas. The proposed
                                        method addresses this problem by considering two other image attributes, namely, contrast and
                                        entropy. All the attributes are determined in the local area. The experimental results show
                                        that the proposed method qualitatively produced better results than the other techniques.
                                        Additionally, according to the survey results, experts agree and support that the proposed
                                        method is better that the current methods in terms of region determination capability.
                                        This research is published in April 2020 at IEEE ACCESS ISI journal with an impact factor of 4.098.

                                    <h2>Project 2: “Adaptive Fuzzy Exposure Local Contrast Enhancement for Non-uniform
                                        Illumination Images.” </h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="image right"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                        This project is based on the results obtained for all three different types of image databases
                                         (i.e. standard, underwater and microscopic human sperm images), the two state-of-the-art methods (i.e. Exposure, and FIM)
                                          were unable to determine the image into three regions. The reason is both methods only provide a single threshold which
                                           can only divide the image into two regions only namely over-exposed and under-exposed. The other state- 
                                           of-the-art region determination method (i.e. Backlit method) is able to determine the image into three 
                                           regions. However, the output of the determined regions was lack of accuracy, which leads to miss-classification
                                            or over or underdetermine of those regions. On the other hand, the proposed ALEBRD method had successfully 
                                            overcome the previous issues by providing the best region determination performance. With prominent results 
                                            presented in this paper, the proposed region determination techniques could be extensively applied in enhancing 
                                            digital images particularly those with non-uniform illumination issues. In addition, the 
                                            proposed region determination technique could aid any segmentation process since it can 
                                            significantly distinguish low contrast regions. This advantage will improve the accuracy of 
                                            detection and diagnosis in various applications. This research is published in April 2020 
                                            at Computing and Visualisation Science ISI journal with the impact factor of 0.69.

                                        Digital image enhancement is one of well-known and the main keys in digital image processing. Digital image enhancement is to 
                                        improve the image quality in a subjective perspective. One of the main issues facing digital image  enhancement is the 
                                        non-uniform illumination and low contrast image enhancement. To solve this issue, it has to enhance the image locally. 
                                        To apply local image enhancement techniques, it has to be determined into regions using image region determination 
                                        techniques to sperate the image into multiple regions based on the pixels distribution value and that to solve the non-uniform
                                         illumination and low contrast image issue. The existing image enhancement techniques classified into three main categories: 
                                         Histogram Modification Based Image Enhancement Techniques, Fuzzy Logic Based Enhancement Techniques, and Other Image Enhancement
                                          techniques. This review paper, presents an overview of digital image processing by focusing on image enhancement and image 
                                          region determination processing techniques. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to classify and review image enhancement 
                                          processing techniques for non-uniform and the low contrast images by presenting the advantages and disadvantages of each 
                                          state-of-the-art 
                                        algorithm in-order to show the direction of digital image enhancement and digital image region determination for future
                                         research.  This research is published in April 2020 
                                            at Computer Science ISI journal with the impact factor of 0.846.
