								<h2>About me </h2>
								I am Abdullah Amer (33 years old) I love all forms technology. 
								I am a specialist in digital image processing, computer vision based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
								I also design mobile apps and web pages. For a hobby I love to do workouts, and play with my pets.</p>
								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
										<a href="https://ee.eng.usm.my/index.php/ms/" target="_blank">School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.ips.usm.my/" target="_blank">University
										Science of Malaysia (USM)</a>, 2018.
									</h3>
									<p>
										My Ph.D. thesis is titled: "Adaptive Local Fuzzy Based Region Determination Image 
										 Enhancement 
										 Techniques for Non-uniform Illumination and Low Contrast Images".
										 It was mainly focusing on image processing and computer vision, based on AI (artificial Intelligent)
										 and Fuzzy Logic. 

										<h4>Motivation</h4>
											Medical images (microscopic, x-ray and MRI images)
											might get affected by the issue of non-uniform illumination and low contrast, which might 
											affect 
											important informations inside those images.
										Therefore, my Ph.D. thesis came to solve this issue with the following objectives: </p>

										<h4>Objectives</h4> 
										1- To detect the early stages of breast cancer by enhancing the biomedical x-ray images and to 
										detect the defect in human sperm by processing the microscopic images. <br />
										2- To determine the non-uniform illumination and low contrast images into three main regions
										 (over-exposed, well-exposed, and under-exposed regions).<br />
										3- To enhance each region individually without coming across the other regions.<br />
										4- To combine the three enhanced regions to be the uniform output image.<br /></p>
										
										<h4>contributions</h4> 
										This study  came out with four main contributions:<br />
										1- A new algorithm titled: Adaptive Local Exposure Based Region Determination.<br />
										2- A new algorithm titled: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8472271" target="_blank">Adaptive Fuzzy Exposure Local
											 Contrast Enhancement.</a><br />
										3- Enhancment and determination system for the non-uniform illumination and low contrast images.<br />
										4- Non-uniform illumination and low contrast image: Systematic Review (research article).<br /></p>

										During the Ph.D. research, I have processed  over 1000 images . 
										All those images are of non-uniform and
										 low contrast.
										 
										My Ph.D. was done under the supervision of <a href="https://ee.eng.usm.my/index.php/ms/our-staf/academic-staff-2019/
										menu-professor-2019/29-infografik-pensyarah-mekatronik-2019/335-professor-ir-dr-nor-ashidi-mat-isa" target="_blank">
										Professor Ir. Dr. Nor Ashidi Mat Isa</a></p>
										<h3>MS.c. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University
											Science of Malaysia (USM), 2014. </h3>

										<p> My MS.c. degree was in the field of digital signal processing (DSP) based on Machine Learning (ML),
											focusing on voice recognition-based biometrics and bioacoustics. 

											My MS.c. degree research helped the medical field in developing a new antibiotic for skin cancer, using 
											rare species of frogs as an animal model. 
											In this study I build and installed a biometric and bioacoustics voice 
											recognition system in a jungle area, in-order to detect, find , and catch those rare frongs.
											 

											<h4>Motivation</h4>
											Nine rare specieses of frogs  were known to be used for producing an
											antibiotic that can heal skin cancer. 
											However, those frog specieses are very hard to find and catch. Therefore, came the need
											 to 
											build a system 
											that can helped with detecting and locating those frogs.</p>

											<h4>Objectives</h4> 
											1- To implement human voice biometric and frog bioacoustics identification systems with 
											different types of machine learning classifiers. <br/>
											2- To evaluate and compare the performance of both developed systems for different types of 
											classifiers. <br /></p>

											<h4>contributions</h4> 
											This study came out with a system that is able to detect the nine different frog species using four different types of
											 machine learning classifiers and two different feature extraction algorithms. <br /></p>
											 My MS.c. was done under the supervision of 
											 <a href="https://ee.eng.usm.my/index.php/ms/our-staf/academic-staff-2019/associate-professor-2019/29-infografik-pensyarah-mekatronik-2019/103-associate-professor-dr-dzati-athiar-ramli" target="_blank">
											 Associate Professor Dr. Dzati Athiar Ramli</a></p>

											<h3>BS.c. in Software Engineering, School of software Engineering, Al-Mansour University Collage, 2008. 
												 </h3>

											
											My final year project was focusing on building a simulation system for the telecommunication protocol named carrier sense multiple 
											access/collision avoidance
											 (CSMA/CA) to understand the behavior and performance of this protocol, in-order to be able to implement it and develop 
											 it in the future.
