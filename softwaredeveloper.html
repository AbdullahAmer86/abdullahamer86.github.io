										In this section I will share with you my software developing experience. 
                                        I will begin with my most favorite projects reaching to the smallest one.
										 I have worked with many programming languages, in several different projects 
										 shown below.  
                                         </p>

                                    <h2>Projects </h2>
                                    
										<h3>Image Processing Projects</h3>
										<p>
										I have done my Graduate Research Assistant project using MATLAB and OpenCV for computer vision, image processing, and
										artificial Intelligence. In this project I worked on image segmentation, region determination and image 
										enhancement. In the two hyperlinks below I am sharing some of the nonconfidential codes that I built.
										</p>

											(image enhancement), MATLAB.</a></li>
                                          <li><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/boemphbz6xs3e/">Image segmentation, MATLAB. </a></li>

									<h3>Artificial Intelligence Projects</h3>
									<ul>
										<ol>
											<li><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/zfxrqssq5s324dy/Smile-o-Meter_Pi-_1.04.zip/file">Unimaker,
												 Mekathon, SMILO METER Project.</a><br />
												 In this project, my team won the Top 5 position in the Unimaker competition 2018.
												 This project was built to detect and evaluate the satisfaction of the tourists
												 at all tourist attractions in Malaysia , based on their facial expressions. This project is an implementation
												  of the
												  HAAR Cascade algorithm,
												  designed using Python programming language.

											</li>
											<li><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/wtqzglehahatbpe/VoiceBasedBiometricSystem.zip/file">Biometrics and Bioacoustic voice recognition.</a><br />
												This project was built for my MS.c. research project that I mentioned in the <a href="generic.html">About Me</a> page. 
 												
											
											
											</li>
										</ol>
									</ul>

								</p> 
                                    <h3>Mobile Apps developing Projects</h3>
									I have worked as a mobile apps developer for iOS using ObjectC programming language, and for Android using JavaScript programming language.
									I have also used Flutter with Dart programming language for both operating systems. Each project was done based on the client's requirements. Therefore, 
									for confidentiality purposes below I will share my own projects only . For more projects, please refer to my 
									<a href= "https://github.com/AbdullahAmer86">GitHub</a> to find all the 
									source codes. 
						
									  
										<ol>
										  <li>iOS using ObjectC "Privet Chat App". </li>
										  This project is called <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/nkfbj97jpoky6/">"Privet Chat App"</a> connect with 
										  Firebase. This app allows you to create a private link between you and the person that you want to privately chat. 
										  It is very useful for small business companies to have their own private chat application without the need to use the a public chat one, for 
										  privacy purposes. 
										   
										   Feel free to use it and implement it  for your own needs
										   
										  <li>Android using JavaScript "Magic Ball App".</li>
										  This application is called  <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ulq88fbgxotip/">"Magic Ball"</a>, also known as "Questions Bank." 
										   You can feed this application with your 
										  own questions and answers, for educational and fun purposes. 

										  <li>Flutter using Dart "Online Store". </li>
										  Flutter is my most favorite application developing enviroment, as I can use it to develop an app for both (iOS and Android) operating systems at the 
										  same time. 
										  One example is my app <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/e121hkhz0l1oj/">"Online Store"</a>,
										  which is used for online shopping. This app can be used for selecting goods and pricing them, while the customer is 
										  placing their order. Feel free to try this application and implement it. 
										  
										</ol>
                                      

                                    <h3>Web Developing</h3>
									I have build many projects for web page developing in PHP, HTML and HTML5. One exampel is this portfolio web page which I have developed 
									   using HTML5. 
									
                                    </p>
